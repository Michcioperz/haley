#example fidgot rules
#Format: "regex" "message"
#rules are checked from top, to down
#the first, that matches is used

#python regular expressions, see 're' documentation
"fidgot:{0,1} hi"         "hi"

#some characters (", \, <, >, (, ) ) can be escaped with \
#\ -> \, \\ -> \, \\\\ -> \\
"fidgot:{0,1} \\\\"         "backslash"

#to insert group from regex put it's name into <>
"fidgot:{0,1} say to (?P<nick>[^\s]*) (?P<msg>.*)" "<nick>: <msg>"
"fidgot:{0,1} say (.*)"   "<1>"

#insert variable put it's name into <>
#predefined variables: $name, $chan, $user
#note that space after $chan is deleted
"<$name>:{0,1} halp" "i'am <$name>, and you are <$user. We are on $chan >."

#rules can be extended over many lines
"fidgot:{0,1} help"  \
"hello, i'm <$name> an irc bot \
i can't do a lot yet, \
but i'm learning"
