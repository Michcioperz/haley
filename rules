#example fidgot rules
#Format: "regex" "message"
#rules are checked from top, to down
#the first, that matches is used

#python regular expressions, see 're' documentation
"fidgot:{0,1} hi"         "hi"

#rules can be extended over many lines
"fidgot help"  \
"hello, i'm an irc bot \
i can't do a lot yet, \
but i'm learning"

#some characters (", \, <, >) are escaped with \
"fidgot:{0,1} \""         "\\"

#to insert group from regex put it's name into <>
"fidgot:{0,1} say to (?P<nick>[^\s]*) (?P<msg>.*)" "<nick>: <msg>"
"fidgot:{0,1} say (.*)"   "<1>"
